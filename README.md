# react-arcgis-hub

A library of [ArcGIS Hub](http://hub.arcgis.com/) components for [React] applications... _and_ [Ember applications](#in-ember)! 

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-arcgis-hub.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-arcgis-hub)

> **NOTE:** This library was an experiment that never ended up being adopted.

Pairs nicely with [@esri/hub.js](https://esri.github.io/hub.js/), and [@esri/arcgis-rest-js](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-arcgis-hub
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-arcgis-hub
```

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react'

// these components render markup that leverages Bootstrap CSS
// NOTE: you do NOT need to supply a Bootstrap JS implementation, but
// you can use these components with react-bootstrap, reactstrap, etc
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
import 'react-arcgis-hub/dist/react-arcgis-hub.css'

// these components rely on react-intl's intl being passed as a prop
import { injectIntl } from 'react-intl'

// a component showing login buttons for ArcGIS Online, Facebook, or Google
import { HubAuthButtons } from 'react-arcgis-hub'

class App extends React.Component {
  onSignIn = (provider) => {
    // TODO: start the OAuth 2 login process after user clicks a button
    // optionally using Facebook or Google as the auth provider
    console.log('TODO: log in w/ :', provider || 'ArcGIS Online')
  }

  render () {
    const { intl } = this.props
    return (
      <HubAuthButtons intl={intl} onSignIn={this.onSignIn} />
    )
  }
}

export default injectIntl(App)
```

### In Ember
See [ember-react-arcgis-hub-test](https://github.com/tomwayson/ember-react-arcgis-hub-test) for an example of an Ember application that uses the components in this library and an explanation of how that works. 

**NOTE**: Supporting usage in Ember also imposes some [constraints](#limitations) on how this library is developed.

## Dependencies

### Bootstrap
The components in this library generate markup that depends on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS. You do **NOT** _need_ to supply a Bootstrap JS implementation, but you _can_ use these components with [react-bootstrap], [reactstrap], etc.

### react-intl
The components in this library are also internationalized and are designed to work w/ [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl). Each component requires a prop named `intl` which is what you get when you use [injectIntl()](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/API#injection-api) (i.e. of type [intlShape](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki/API#intlshape)).

#### Configuring react-intl

The default translations for this libary are distributed with the built code.

See how the [Example app loads the translations from this library and configures react-intl](./example/src/AppWrapper.js).

## Limitations

Because this library does not bundle or depend on any React implementation of interactive Bootstrap components ([react-bootstrap], [reactstrap], etc), the library's components can **not** contain those Bootstrap components. This works fine for modals, tabs, and collapses because the library component can be just contents that go in the container. However, it is a significant limitation to not be able to use others like tooltips, drop downs, and button groups in the library. Supporting use in Ember makes this constraint more acute.

Similarly, I've chosen not to bundle react-intl with the react-arcgis-hub components and instead am expecting the consuming app to pass an `intl` prop to each component. This is largely in order to support using these components [in Ember](#in-ember). This works because react-intl and ember-intl share underlying libraries and browser primitives and have very similar APIs. However, this means that react-arcgis-hub components cannot use react-intl's convenience components like `<FormattedDate>`, etc and must instead use the functions exposed by `this.props.intl` and/or a [few utility functions](./src/utils/index.ts) that handle a couple of differences in the APIs exposed by ember-intl.

## Development

This library was created with [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library).

Follow these [development instructions](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library#development) to build and run the library and example app locally.
